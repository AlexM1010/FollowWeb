"""
Analysis layer components for FollowWeb Network Analysis.

This module provides network analysis algorithms and computations:
- Community detection and network analysis coordination
- Centrality calculations (degree, betweenness, eigenvector)
- Shortest path calculations and contact path analysis
- Influential account detection and fame metrics

Modules:
    network: NetworkAnalyzer class and community detection
    centrality: Centrality calculation algorithms
    paths: PathAnalyzer class and shortest path calculations
    fame: FameAnalyzer class and influential account detection
