# Freesound Library - Persistent Data Storage

This directory contains the persistent Freesound sample library that grows over time.

## Files:
- `freesound_library.pkl` - Main library checkpoint (graph + cache)
- `freesound_library_backup_*.pkl` - Automatic backups

## Purpose:
This data is committed to Git so the library persists across:
- PC crashes
- System reinstalls
- Team collaboration
- CI/CD runs

## Size Management:
If files get too large for Git, consider:
- Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- Cloud storage with download script
- Incremental snapshots
